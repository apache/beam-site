# Policies

This page contains a list of major policies agreed upon by the Apache Beam community.

## Releases

Apache Beam makes minor releases every 6 weeks. Apache Beam has a [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=0p73sl034k80oob7seouanigd0%40group.calendar.google.com) for cutting the next release branch. Once a release branch is cut, the community works quickly to finalize that release.

Apache Beam aims to make 8 releases in a 12 month period. In order to accommodate users with longer upgrade cycles some of these release will be tagged long term support (LTS) releases. Every fourth release starting from the 2.7.0 release will be a LTS release. LTS releases will receive patches for 12 months starting from their initial release dates for major issues. LTS releases will be considered deprecated after 12 months. Non-LTS releases will never receive patches and they will be considered deprecated immediately after the next minor release following them. All users are encouraged to update early and often and not wait until the deprecation date of the version they have in use.

It is up to the Apache Beam community to decide whether an identified issue is a major issue or not that will warrant a patch release. Some example major issues are high severity security issues and high risk data integrity issues.


If you wish to report a security vulnerability, please contact [security@apache.org](mailto:security@apache.org). Apache Beam follows the typical [Apache vulnerability handling process](https://apache.org/security/committers.html#vulnerability-handling).
