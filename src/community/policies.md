# Policies

This page contains a list of major policies agreed upon by the Apache Beam community.

## Releases

Apache Beam makes minor releases every 6 weeks. Apache Beam has a [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=0p73sl034k80oob7seouanigd0%40group.calendar.google.com) for cutting the next release branch. Once a release branch  is cut, the community works quickly to finalize that release.
