# Apache Beam Python SDK _[Under Development]_

The Beam Python SDK is currently under development on a feature branch. Would you like to contribute? See the Beam [Work in Progress]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/work-in-progress/#feature-branches) page to find out how you can help!

Get started with the [Beam Programming Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/learn/programming-guide) to learn the basic concepts that hold for all SDKs in the Beam Model.

## Managing Python Pipeline Dependencies

When you run your pipeline locally, the packages that your pipeline depends on are available because they are installed on your local machine. However, when you want to run your pipeline remotely, you must make sure these dependencies are available on the remote machines. [Managing Python Pipeline Dependencies]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/sdks/python-pipeline-dependencies) shows you how to make your dependencies available to the remote workers.
