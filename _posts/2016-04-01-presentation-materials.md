Are you interested in giving a presentation about Apache Beam? Perhaps you want to talk about Apache Beam at a local Meetup or a convention. Excellent!  The Apache Beam community is excited to expand and grow the community. To help kickstart this process, we are excited to announce an initial set of [Apache Beam presentation materials]({{ site.baseurl }}/presentation-materials/) which anyone can use to give a presentation about Apache Beam.

<!--more-->

This is the first of many steps the Apache Beam community will take to create presentation materials. The Beam community has worked together to ensure these materials are accurate, up-to-date, and relevant. This initial release includes the following presentation materials:

* The Apache Beam model
    * Long version
    * Short version
* Using Apache Beam with runners
    * Google Cloud Dataflow

As Apache Beam grows, so will this repository of presentation materials. Specifically, we will add new materials as the Apache Beam ecosystem grows with new runners, SDKs, and so on. If you are interested in contributing content or have a request, please see the [Apache Beam presentation materials]({{ site.baseurl }}/presentation-materials/) page or email the [`user@beam.incubator.apache.org`](mailto:user@beam.incubator.apache.org) mailing list.
