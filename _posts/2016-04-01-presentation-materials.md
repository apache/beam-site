Are you interested in giving a presentation about Apache Beam? Perhaps you want to talk about Apache Beam at a local Meetup or a convention. We want to help you grow the Apache Beam community! To make things easier, we have added an initial set of [Apache Beam presentation materials]({{ site.baseurl }}/presentation-materials/). These materials have been crafted by experts in the Apache Beam community and held to the same high quality standards as the Apache Beam codebase.

<!--more-->

This means you now have instant access to several high-quality presentations covering several Apache Beam topics, including:

* The Apache Beam model
    * Long version
    * Short version
* Using Apache Beam with runners
    * Google Cloud Dataflow

We will add new materials as the Apache Beam ecosystem grows with new runners, SDKs, and so on. If you would like to see a specific topic covered, please email the [`user@beam.incubator.apache.org`](mailto:user@beam.incubator.apache.org) mailing list.
