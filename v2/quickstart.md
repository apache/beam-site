# Quickstart

The Apache Beam project is in the Apache Incubator (it's what we call a podling).
This includes the creation of project resources, the refactoring of the initial code submission, and the formulation of project documentation, planning, and design documents.
Until the project is fully initialized, this page contains useful resources to learn more about the model and tools which comprise Apache Beam.

_TODO: add quickstart sample_

The samples and documentation provide details.
